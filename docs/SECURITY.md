## Security Best Practices for Contributors

<details>
<summary><strong>Never commit secrets</strong></summary>

API keys, passwords, tokens, and private keys must never appear in source code or git history. Use `.env` files (gitignored) and reference `.env.example` for the expected variable names.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Use pre-commit hooks</strong></summary>

This repo includes a gitleaks pre-commit hook that blocks commits containing secrets. Run `pre-commit install` after cloning.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Run <code>make secrets-check</code> before pushing</strong></summary>

This checks that `.env` is not committed and, if gitleaks is installed, scans for leaked secrets. See Makefile.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Rotate compromised keys immediately</strong></summary>

If a key is accidentally committed, rotate it in the provider's dashboard, purge from git history (e.g. with `git filter-repo`), and notify the maintainers.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Keep dependencies updated</strong></summary>

CI runs `pip-audit` and `npm audit` automatically. Address high/critical findings promptly.
