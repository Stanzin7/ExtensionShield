# Production Deployment

This guide covers production deployment basics and the Supabase migration flow.

## Railway Deployment (Recommended)

For detailed Railway deployment instructions, see **[RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md](RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

**Quick Railway Deploy:**

```bash
# 1. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
# 2. Deploy using CLI
railway up

# OR use the helper script
./scripts/deploy.sh

# OR use make
make deploy
```

**Required Environment Variables for Railway:**

Frontend (build-time):
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous/public key

Backend (runtime):
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Supabase service role key (keep secret!)
- `LLM_PROVIDER` - LLM provider (e.g., "openai")
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key (if using OpenAI)

See [RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md](RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete setup instructions.

## Key Environment Variables

Required for Supabase-backed production:

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (server-side only)
- `DATABASE_URL` (or `SUPABASE_DB_URL`)

Optional:

- `DB_BACKEND=supabase` (auto-detected if Supabase vars are set)
- `PORT` (defaults to 8007)

## Migrations (Auto-run on Deploy)

Production startup runs migrations **before** the API server when:

- `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are set, and
- `DB_BACKEND` is **not** `sqlite`

If migrations fail, startup exits non-zero so deploy fails fast.

The runner is:

- `scripts/run_supabase_migrations.py`

It applies SQL files in `docs/supabase_migrations/` in order and tracks
applied migrations in `public.schema_migrations`.

You can also run it manually:

```bash
python scripts/run_supabase_migrations.py
```

See `docs/MIGRATIONS.md` for full details.

## Start Command (Production)

Container startup uses:

```
scripts/start_api.sh
```

This script conditionally runs Supabase migrations and then starts the API:

```
uvicorn extension_shield.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8007}
```

## Verify Migrations

In Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
select * from public.schema_migrations order by applied_at;
```
