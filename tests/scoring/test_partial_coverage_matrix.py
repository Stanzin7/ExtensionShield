"""
Regression tests for the partial-coverage guard (audit finding #11).

The bug: insufficient-data handling was all-or-nothing — it only fired when SAST,
VirusTotal, AND network analysis ALL produced no coverage. So a SAST-only scan
(SAST ran, found nothing) with NO VirusTotal and NO network analysis produced a
high-score clean ALLOW (~96/100), even though the two highest-signal analyzers
(malware + exfiltration) never ran.

The fix: when VirusTotal AND network coverage are both missing, the score is
capped into the review band and the verdict is forced to NEEDS_REVIEW — even when
SAST ran. This file pins that across the full coverage matrix.

Note: the in-repo network analyzer does not yet populate network signals, so in
practice "no network" is the common case; this guard means a scan without
VirusTotal cannot self-clear as a confident high-score ALLOW.
